                Nuclear Fusion, if done at an industrial level, will change how our society operates in ways never imagined. Abundant, clean energy at our disposal
                would break down the barriers to advancements we are currently trying to crack. This article explores the history of nuclear development and what it
                entails, a discussion on the benefits fusion could have to our society, and the issues and challenges scientists are facing with achieving it. 
                Contemporary research is also explored which provides promising results that may indicate how far we are from it.

               Nuclear fusion has only been a known concept since the 1920’s when the paper named, ‘Internal Constitution of the Stars’ written by Arthur Eddington,
               suggested that the stars generate their energy through the fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium, which laid the basis of modern theoretical astrophysics
               (Robert Arnoux, 2014). In the 1930’s, Hans Bethe recognised that the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form deuterium was found to be exoergic, meaning that 
               there is a net release of energy (Robert W. Conn, no date). This led to the first fusion reactors being built, many of them being inspired by the Tokomak 
               design. The first Tokomak inspired reactor was built in 1958 which became very successful as advances from these experiments led to the Joint European Torus
               (JET), in the 1990’s (Matthew Lanctot, no date). JET used the mix of deuterium and tritium and broke records concerning net power energy even as recent as 2022.
               In this instance, European scientists produced stable plasmas with ‘59 megajoules of energy output’ surpassing the world record (Daniel Clery, 2022).
