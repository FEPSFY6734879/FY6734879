 Nuclear Fusion, if done at an industrial level, will change how our society operates in ways never imagined. Abundant, clean energy at our disposal would break down the barriers to advancements we are currently trying to crack. This article explores the history of nuclear development and what it entails, a discussion on the benefits fusion could have to our society, and the issues and challenges scientists are facing with achieving it.  Contemporary research is also explored which provides promising results that may indicate how far we are from it.

     <h3 class="headings" id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

     <p class="ex1">

Nuclear fusion has only been a known concept since the 1920’s when the paper named, ‘Internal Constitution of the Stars’ written by Arthur Eddington, suggested that the stars generate their energy through the fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium, which laid the basis of modern theoretical astrophysics (Robert Arnoux, 2014). In the 1930’s, Hans Bethe recognised that the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form deuterium was found to be exoergic, meaning that there is a net release of energy (Robert W. Conn, no date). This led to the first fusion reactors being built, many of them being inspired by the Tokomak design. The first Tokomak inspired reactor was built in 1958 which became very successful as advances from these experiments led to the Joint European Torus (JET), in the 1990’s (Matthew Lanctot, no date). JET used the mix of deuterium and tritium and broke records concerning net power energy even as recent as 2022. In this instance, European scientists produced stable plasmas with ‘59 megajoules of energy output’ surpassing the world record (Daniel Clery, 2022).

     <h3 class="headings" id="Required Conditions for Fusion">Required Conditions for Fusion</h3>

     <p class="ex1">

Fusion reactions require extreme conditions for them to occur. The conditions being temperature, density, and time. In the sun, H-H reactions occur under temperatures of over 10 million degrees. On Earth, instead of H-H reactions, we work with D-T reactions instead (H2-H3) because of the lower atmospheric pressure, the required temperatures need to reach 100 million degrees. (EUROfusion, no date). High densities are needed so enough fusion reactions can happen for it to be self-sustaining (U.S. Fusion Energy, no date).  At these temperatures and densities, the nuclei of these isotopes exist in the state of plasma which is where the electrons are ripped away from the atoms which creates an ionised gas (PSFC, no date). As the plasma is heated, the number of reactions increase over time so enough time must pass for it to generate enough energy. There are many methods to achieve these temperatures. For example, there have been inertial confinement fusion experiments involving laser-driven implosions of spherical D-T targets which have seen successful results (Z. L. Mohamed, Y. Kim, J. P. Knauer, and M. S. Rubery, 2023).

     <h3 class="headings" id="Benefits of Fusion">Benefits for Fusion</h3>

     <p class="ex1">

The reason why fusion has been such a hot topic, especially in the scientific community, is because of the many benefits it has over other energy sources we are using. A couple of examples include it emits no carbon emissions and that it is a more reliable source of energy than renewables. The fusion process causes no harmful atmospheric emissions making it an extremely desirable energy source to pursue (Matteo Barbarino, 2023). The main reason being this could help with the rising requirement for more energy and the environmental issues we are facing due to fossil fuels that is being widely used: the biggest contributor to global warming. Another benefit is that it is a very reliable source of energy. Where renewable sources of energy are reliant of certain variables, for example, solar power is dependent on the exposure of electromagnetic radiation from the sun, fusion reactions only depend on the reactor its takes place in. Fusion reactors will be designed to produce a continuous supply of large amounts of electricity (Culham Centre Fusion Energy, 2022).

     <h3 class="headings" id="Challenges being faced">Challenges being faced</h3>

     <p class="ex1">
  
The remaining issues with fusion is that it presents problems that scientists have been trying to solve for decades therefore gaining the reputation of it always being on the brink of discovery. The challenges we are facing with fusion are mainly those of engineering but also of politics. In terms of engineering, the main issue being the design of a device that is able to heat the deuterium-tritium fuel to a high enough temperature, 100-200 million degrees, and be able to sustain for a long enough time for fusion top occur. These are the conditions necessary for fusion reactions to occur (Derek A. Sunderland, 2018). Another challenge is that even though a typical fusion reaction releases 3-4 times more energy than that of a fission reaction, the number of fusion reactions in plasma per second is less than fission reactions in a solid medium. Therefore, the heat yield per reaction for fusion is 70 times less than that of fission (World Nuclear Association, no date). Therefore, the reactors that are required for fusion will have to be larger, making it more costly than a fission reactor with the same power output.

     <p class="ex1">

Things are starting to finally look up in the fusion industry, especially when it comes to recent results and newfound interest in governments willing to invest. The biggest breakthrough that has happened with fusion occurred last year in 2022 when scientists at the US National Ignition Facility created a reaction that reached ignition for the first time (Jeff Tollefson & Elizabeth Gibney, 2022). They achieved this by pointing the facility’s 192 lasers to administer 2.05 megajoules of energy at a tiny pellet of frozen deuterium and tritium which compressed the pellet generating temperatures and pressures large enough to cause the isotopes to fuse, releasing 3.15 megajoules of energy (Michael Greshko, 2022). Hence, net energy gain was achieved. Following this, in 2023 alone the fusion industry has seen a huge boost in funding especially in the UK as the government has put forward a strategy of investing £650 million into the creation of more than 2,200 training places across the country, a new fuel cycle testing facility and funding into developing infrastructure for private fusion companies (Andrew Bowie 2023).

     <h3 class="headings" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

     <p class="ex1">


In conclusion, nuclear fusion is likely to occur in the foreseeable future, however, many challenges need to be overcame in order to make it achievable. Increased funding from governments and the industrialisation of nuclear fusion could make it the biggest energy source on earth and will help solve pressing issues, especially regarding the environment.
